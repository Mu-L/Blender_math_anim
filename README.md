# Blender3D Math Animation Addon 

</div>

Inspired by [3Blue1Brown Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) for science explainatory, I create this 
tool for the same purpose based on Blender which is much fancier and more powerful to unlock your 
creativity. It is very intuitive to use for those who don't have code based skills. If you are familiar 
with Blender, the unleashing power will enable you astornishing the world.
